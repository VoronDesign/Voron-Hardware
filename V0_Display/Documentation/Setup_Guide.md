## V0 Display Flashing Instructions:##

1) Connect the board to the host Raspberry Pi via USB.
2) This step depends on if your board has firmware on it or not already:
	a}If you have a pre-flashed board:
		-Install the boot jumper and reset the board. This will put the board into DFU mode.
	
	b}If you have an unflashed board:
		- The MCU default's to DFU mode if there is no other firmware installed.
		
	confirm the board enters DFU mode in step 4
	
3) Connect to your host raspberry pi via SSH
4) run `lsusb` from the command prompt
	- Make sure you see an STM32 in DFU mode listed
5) run `dfu-util --list` from the command prompt
	- note the text inside the [xxxx:yyyy]
6) Run `CD ~/klipper` from the command line to enter the Klipper directory
7) Run `make menuconfig` settings should be:

	- [\*] Enable extra low-level configuration options 
 
	- Micro-controller Architecture (STMicroelectronics STM32)

	- Processor model (STM32F042)

	- Clock Reference (Internal clock)

	- [\*] Use USB for communication (instead of serial)

	- [\*] Use PA9/PA10 for USB or CAN

	- USB ids  --->[ ] Specify a custom step pulse duration

	- ()  GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup 
	
	Exit and Save
8) Run `make clean` to clean up the make environment.
9) Run `make flash FLASH_DEVICE=xxxx:yyyy` (using xxxx:yyyy from above)
10) After completion `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*` should return a device begining with `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f042x6...`

Your board should now be usable with Klipper. Use the `example.cfg` to get started
