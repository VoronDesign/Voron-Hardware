# Voron 2.4 XY Microswitch Endstop
Microswitch endstop board for X and Y axes. Designed with Omron D2F-L switches in mind, however, others might work as well. You can use whatever connector you want. It is wire compatible with the hall effect board. The VIN pin is not used. If you have no intention of switching to the hall effect board, you can run 3 wires instead of 4 as it shares a common ground.

You will need a different stl for the pod.
