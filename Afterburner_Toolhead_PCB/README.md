![PCB](Images/Rev3.1/1.png)


### NOTE: THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS BOARD GOING AROUND, THE WIRING DIAGRAM IS FOR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION AS POSTED HERE. IF YOU BOUGHT FROM ME OR ANYONE ELSE ON THE FLEA MARKET AND HAVE ANY QUESTIONS DM ME ON DISCORD

## The board has: ##
 - BAT85 Diode for abl probe
 - Indicator LED to show when hotend is on
 - 2/3/4 pin headers for most components on the toolhead
 - 2 Pin Microfit 3.0 for the heater
 - 0402 pkg thermistor to be used as a chamber temperature 
 - 14 Pin Microfit 3.0 for the main connector back to the MCU 
  
This board was designed to make wiring the toolhead a bit easier, to help get rid of some of the crimps needs on these wires. 


Since this board has provisions for the X endstop, this should be compatible with V1, V2, and Switchwire
