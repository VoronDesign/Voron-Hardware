# Afterburner Toolhead Board #
![PCB](Images/1.png)


## The board has: ##
 - BAT85 Diode for abl probe
 - Indicator LED to show when hotend is on
 - 2/3/4 pin headers for most components on the toolhead
 - 2 Pin Microfit 3.0 for the heater
 - 0402 pkg thermistor to be used as a chamber temperature 
  
This board was designed to make wiring the toolhead a bit easier, to help get rid of some of the crimps needs on these wires. 


Since this board has provisions for the X endstop, this should be compatible with V1, V2, and Switchwire
