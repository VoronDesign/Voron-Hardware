# Compress, Extend, Uncompress

![Solidworks overview of the PCB's](/V0-Umbilical/Images/Overview.png?raw=true "Title")

This mod adds two PCBs ([Frame PCB](#frame-pcb), [Toolhead PCB](#toolhead-pcb)) and a cable ([Umbilical Cable](#umbilical-cable)) to the V0.1 that can aid in wire management and routing as well as making the toolhead able to be swappable.
The frame PCB mounts between the A/B motors at the back of the printer and condenses the heater, thermistor, part cooling fan, hotend cooling fan, extruder motor and the X-endstop into a single 14 pin Micro-Fit 3.0 connector while also adding a chamber thermistor and hookups for 3 continous NeoPixel (WS2812) strips.

# Frame PCB
Mounting between the motors, this board takes in all the wires and merges them into a 14 pin harness.

# Toolhead PCB

Mounting on the toolhead, this breaks out the 14 pin harness into all needed connectors, including a second part fan connector so the user doesn't have to spice both fans together.

# Umbilical cable

The Umbilical cable is a 220-240mm dual ended 14P (2x7) microfit cable. The connectors are wired 1:1 so pin 1 connects to pin 1 and so forth for all 14 pins.


*Only 2 of the 14 wires are shown for clarity. Connect each number to its matching number.*
