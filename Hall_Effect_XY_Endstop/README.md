XY Endstop

# MZBOT XY Endstop
Hall effect endstop board for X and Y axes

The Hall Effect board allows contact less homing for X and Y axis on a Voron 2.When hall sensor reaches close to magnet it produces a voltage. The circuit then compares that with a reference voltage. The compartor flips based on threshold set by using the trim pots.
Please follow followin procedure to setup Hall Effect Board.
1) Make sure both the pots are centered.
2) Then take a magnet for x axis.Try both the poles. Find the pole of manget that triggers sensor within 1 inch of magnet.
3) Install the X magnet into afterburner carraige.
4) Please repeat the same process for Y axis and then install it in zblock.
